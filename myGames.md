In the last few years, I've been part of many projects and have made a handful of games! Please check them out below! 

I jump from role to role and often work where most help is needed, but I most frequently act as a 3D artist, programmer and tester!

Below is a list of completed projects. Check [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-05-18-in progress %}) for a list of projects in progress!
