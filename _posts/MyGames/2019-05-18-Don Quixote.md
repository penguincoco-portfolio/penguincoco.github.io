### **About the Don Quixote Quests**
Enter the world of Don Quixote, now imagined as an open-world adventure RPG filled with new and already existing characters. Take on the role of Rodrigo, a Santa Hermandad officer, and adventure around the world of 17th century Spain. 

**Please check out the game [here](https://penguincoco.itch.io/don-quixote-narrative-assignment)!**

For an intermediate game design course, one project was to take an existing IP and write 2 open-world styled side quests and 1 main quest taking place in the universe. 

In these three side quests, you play as Rodrigo, a Santa Hermandad officer that experiences the consequences of Don Quixote's actions and is ultimately tasked with arresting him. 

**Side Quest 1**: Anguiano. Reports are coming in of people disappearing from the village of Anguiano, and screams can be heard from a farm just outside of the town. Investigate the supposed violence on the farm brooding on the outskirts of Anguiano.

**Side Quest 2**: Cardenio. Rodrigo's hopes of a quiet day and visitation to an old bartender friend get ruined when the bar gets robbed. Help your friend get his belongings back and try to figure out why the robber struck. 

**Main Quest**: Arrest Don Quixote. There are reports coming in from all over the country of a crazy man wearing a full suit of armour, going by the name of Don Quixote, and a stout man causing mass destruction everywhere they go. Rodrigo and his partner, Francisco, are tasked with finding this troublesome pair and bringing him to justice. But do you have what it takes to arrest the so-called Don Quixote?

### **My Role on the Project**
Having never read any of the books, I did a lot of in-depth research and ended up with a brief (but still 20-page long) research doc that included things as basic as a summary of both of the books to advanced as thematic elements such as perspective and narration, Quixotism and chivalry and morality, and class and worth. These two side quests and main quest, in tandem, intend to explore morality and through that lens, develop the new add-on character of Rodrigo. 


### **What I Learned**
This project was my first experience ever using Twine, and I learned a lot about how to use the software. Although there were things I wanted to implement (like sound) but ran out of time to do so, it was also a motivator to continue learning about the engine, even after the project ended. 

Growing up, I loved writing. Before this project, I'd written countless short stories, but this was my first major solo project in narrative design and game writing. As a text-based game, it was difficult to give the illusion of being an open-world, branching narrative adventure game. The project underwent lots of playtesting and changed a lot based on the feedback, but ultimately was extremely successful and well-received by both my professors and classmates.
