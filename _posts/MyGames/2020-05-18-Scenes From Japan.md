### **About Scenes From Japan**
Discover the scenery of life in Japan in this 3D walking sim made in Unreal Engine.  


### **Why?**
This is intended less as being a game but an exercise in 3D modelling and art, substance painter, some level design and refining knowledge of Unreal Engine.

**Project Start Date: 15 June, 2020**

**Intended Finish Date: habitual** 


### **Project Gallery**

Please enjoy various WIPs from the ongoing development of _Scenes From Japan_!

_I've spent the last 3 days working on a bicycle! A key object in the scene. Modelling this was a bit difficult, as there were a lot of curves, but it was a good learning process! I took advantage of the curve tool and abused the bevelling. The curves also made UV mapping a little difficult (or at least, more challenging than cube-shaped objects), and it took nearly a day just to finish the map. UV mapping is not my strong suit, so although there's still room for improvement, I'm quite happy with how they came out. The textures are a mix of Substance Painter built-ins and textures found on Substance Share._
