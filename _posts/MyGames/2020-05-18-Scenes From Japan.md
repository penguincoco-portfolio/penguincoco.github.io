### **About Scenes From Japan**
Discover the scenery of life in Japan in this 3D walking sim made in Unreal Engine.  


### **Why?**
This is a project that I've been wanting to do for a long time, for many reasons. 
I lived in Tokyo for a while, and if there was one thing that is incredibly unique to Tokyo, and my favourite part about living in the city, was the mood of residential areas. Despite being two opposite atmospheres, Tokyo neighbourhoods strike such a unique and perfect balance between urban hub and quiet residential life. I want to be able to capture this feeling.

This is intended less as being a game but an exercise in 3D modelling and art, substance painter, some level design and refining knowledge of Unreal Engine.

I'm not particularly good at drawing. I can draw humans alright, but my environments and landscapes are downright atrocious. But with 3D art, I can finally create the things I've always wanted to create! 

**Project Start Date: 25 June, 2020**

**Intended Finish Date: habitual**

_Project moodboard. The atmosphere of the level should feel crowded (narrow streets; bikes, vending machines, potted plants lining the streets) but calm and quiet. Tokyo, despite being a large city, is very quiet and residential. Along residential streets, there is a somewhat organised chaos of utility poles, vending machines, bicycles, cars, post boxes and garbage collection sites._

_Hey Howdy Hey! It's been a while since I've been able to update this project! The last few weeks, my co-dev and I have been sprinting massively on our project ["The Autumn of Terror"]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-05-18-Autumn of Terror %})! Haven't had a free moment in weeks! Just a minor update on this project to show that it's still alive and kicking! I added models for a little local restaurant, along with a Honda NBox! The NBox will not be placed there permanently (it may be odd to have a car right outside of a restaurant like that! But I've placed it there temporarily to show off the asset!_

_Can't have a Japanese neighbourhood scene without a vending machine! This took quite a long time to make. The modelling itself was not as difficult, but I spent a long time making the labels in photoshop (or, rather, abusing the wand and magnetic lasso tools in photoshop!) The vending machine itself still has yet to be textured, but the bottles and buttons are completed._

_I've spent the last 3 days working on a bicycle! A key object in the scene. Modelling this was a bit difficult, as there were a lot of curves, but it was a good learning process! I took advantage of the curve tool and abused the bevelling. The curves also made UV mapping a little difficult (or at least, more challenging than cube-shaped objects), and it took nearly a day just to finish the map. UV mapping is not my strong suit, so although there's still room for improvement, I'm quite happy with how they came out. The textures are a mix of Substance Painter built-ins and textures found on Substance Share._
