### **My Role on the Project**

For the final project of an intermediate game development course. The assignment was to clone a low poly 3D game using Unity. I, along with 3 other students, chose to clone the Meteo level of Nintendo's Star Fox 64.

All four of us on the team were generalists and scurried from role to role as needed. My major contributions to this project were the technical implementations of shooting (basic shooting, tripleshot, locking onto targets, charged shooting), all game menus and UI elements. Additionally, I modelled the enemy mech and powerups in Maya and created all UI components and the Skybox (the health bar, ship icon and bomb icon) in Photoshop. 


### **What I Learned**
The goal of this final project was to simulate an actual game development studio environment with our professor acting as a supervisor. We set strict deadlines for the production schedule, did weekly stand ups and frequently conducted code reviews. Also, although the team was small, nonetheless there were still multiple people working on the project at once and we learned workflow using multiple concurrently active branches and git. 

For me, this project was a highly beneficial learning experience in terms of learning the vocabulary needed to work on large projects with others and how to clearly convey ideas. It also helped me to understand the timeline and iterative process of developing a game. As much as I wanted to jump right into modelling, it was very clear from the beginning of the project that the level needed to be greyboxed with primitive shapes and that core systems had to be developed first in order to make it playtestable.
Additionally, although the final code implementation of the shooting could have been cleaner by using a State Machine (towards the end of the project, I also was coincidentally learning about State Machines in my Computer Science courses!), it was a great learning experience for the utility of State Machines for future projects. Actually, autumn of 2020, I am currently an engineer on a University of Southern California thesis project. The player has a shooting ability which I've implemented using a State Machine! This current project has shooting far less complex than the shooting in Star Fox, but I wonder if I hadn't learned from the Star Fox clone, would I still be implementing things in buggy and needlessly complex ways?
