### **About Star Fox 64 Clone**
Experience the classic Nintendo game Star Fox 64 remade using Unity3D and now on PC! Pilot the Arwing, and shoot your way through the Asteroid Field Meteo! 

**Please check out the game [here](https://penguincoco.itch.io/star-fox-64-clone)!**

For one of my intermediate game development courses, the final project was to clone a low-poly 3D game using Unity. I, along with 3 other students, chose to clone the Meteo level of Nintendo’s Star Fox 64.

### **My Role on the Project**

As part of the requirements for the final project, all team members were required to program and model. My major contribution to this project, codewise, was the implementation of shooting (basic shooting, tripleshot, locking onto targets, charged shooting). I also created the menu system and handled all UI elements. 

I modelled the mech and power ups in maya and created all UI components and the SkyBox (the life bar, ship icon and bomb icon) in photoshop.


### **What I Learned**
The goal of this final project was to simulate an actual game development studio environment with our professor acting as a supervisor. We set strict deadlines for the production schedule, did weekly stand ups and frequently conducted code reviews.

For me, this project was a highly beneficial learning experience in terms of learning the vocabulary needed to work on large projects with others and how to clearly convey ideas. It also helped me to understand the timeline and iterative process of developing a game. As much as I wanted to jump right into modelling, it was very clear from the beginning of the project that the level needed to be greyboxed with primitive shapes and that core systems had to be developed first in order to make it playtestable.
