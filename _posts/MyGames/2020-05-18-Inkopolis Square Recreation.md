### **About Recreating Inkopolis Square**
A recreation of Inkopolis Square from Splatoon 2, all modelled in Maya and assembled in UE4! 


### **Why?**
I'm an avid Splatoon 2 player! (Roller and bucket gang, rise up!) 
On top of that, I really love the layout of Inkopolis Square, it feels so visually interesting without being cluttered. I've been running around the square a lot to capture different buildings and objects at all different angles, and it's really increased my appreciation for the set dressing and general level design of the space.

I began this process on the 5th of October, 2020, and it may take a long time to finish the entire place! This Inkopolis Square recreation is just something I plan on doing in my freetime to grow my skills with Maya, Substance, Photoshop and UE4 :)
