### **About Recreating Inkopolis Square**
A recreation of Inkopolis Square from Splatoon 2, all modelled in Maya and assembled in UE4! 


### **Why?**
I'm an avid Splatoon 2 player! (Roller and bucket gang, rise up!) 
On top of that, I really love the layout of Inkopolis Square, it feels so visually interesting without being cluttered. I've been running around the square a lot to capture different buildings and objects at all different angles, and it's really increased my appreciation for the set dressing and general level design of the space.

I began this process on the 5th of October, 2020, and it may take a long time to finish the entire place! This Inkopolis Square recreation is just something I plan on doing in my freetime to grow my skills with Maya, Substance, Photoshop and UE4 :)

_Added a bunch of small details to the front of the truck, and it's finally starting to look like Crusty Sean's food truck! Also cut out the windows and did some material testing with the glass, although that isn't entirely visible in these screenshots :(_
