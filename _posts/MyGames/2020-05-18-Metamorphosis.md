### **About Metamorphosis**
Metamorphosis is a 2D Puzzle Platformer made in Unity that is aboutabout empathizing and forming a personal connection with nature by performing selfless acts for the good of the environment. Through eating toxic goo, the Player character uses the energy drawn from it to save creatures trapped by this invasive toxicity.

### **My Role on the Project**

As one of the lead engineers, I am largely responsible for camera programming, creature programming, visual effects design and programming and narrative system implementation. As a Unity developer, I am constantly helping out sound designers, level designers and artists to implement the assets they create and make sure they are triggered properly. 

On top of this, I've also been brought into a Game Designer role and Visual Designer role. I frequently help the Level Designer design and test certain segments of levels as well as use the modular assets given by the Environment Artists to dress the scene in Unity and make it come to life. So far, I've done the majority of the lighting design on the level as well.


### **What I Learned**

This project was a huge learning experience for me. I learned a lot about camera programming, scripting cutscenes and designing a locked puzzle system (for example, if you don't complete an optional puzzle in the beginning of the level, the conditions of the environment will be different as you progress through the level).

This was also the largest, and most spread out team that I'd worked with (the team numbered almost 20 people, and spanned across multiple time zones). I learned a lot about communicating with people of various backgrounds and disciplines.
