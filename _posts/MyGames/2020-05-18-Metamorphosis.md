### **About Metamorphosis**
Metamorphosis is a 2D Puzzle Platformer made in Unity that is aboutabout empathizing and forming a personal connection with nature by performing selfless acts for the good of the environment. 

Through eating toxic goo, the Player character can use the energy drawn from it to save creatures trapped by this invasive toxicity.

The game is still in development, and set to be released in Spring 2021! Please check the project's update on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Metamorph_Game)!


### **My Role on the Project**

As one of the lead engineers, I am largely responsible for camera programming, creature programming, visual effects design and programming and narrative system implementation. As a Unity developer, I am constantly helping out sound designers, level designers and artists to implement the assets they create and make sure they are triggered properly. 

On top of this, I've also been brought into a Game Designer role and Visual Designer role. I frequently help the Level Designer design and test certain segments of levels as well as use the modular assets given by the Environment Artists to dress the scene in Unity and make it come to life. 


### **What I Learned**

Just like how the project is still ongoing, I am still ongoing learning things every day to make this project the best it can be.

I'd never done any camera programming before, or scripted any cutscenes, and yet I became the narrative programmer. This involves designing the puzzle system to play cutscenes when a puzzle is solved.
