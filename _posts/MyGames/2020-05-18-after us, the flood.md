### **About _after us, the flood_**

_after us, the flood_ is a narrative game with rhythm mechanics that explores themes of stagnation. 

You wake up as Piper, an amnesiac with a knack for music. Together with the overly friendly Fidel, a resident of the strange yet nostalgic town you've found yourself in, romp around in a dilapidated mall and learn more about a place, and people, who've chosen to be frozen in time.

### **My Role on the Project**

As part of the Game Design BFA, all graduating seniors are required to complete a capstone project. I joined the team halfway through the project as a VFX artist but also ended up working heavily as a programmer, game designer and generally worked wherever I was needed.

As a VFX artist, I designed various visual effects such as dissolving and ripple effects seen in the rhythm game. As a programmer, I borrowed some of the logic from the previous programmer's implementation and redeveloped it from a physics-based system to a time-based system. I also ended up playtesting the game a lot, as well as giving it to others to play, to balance it. Initially, the rhythm game felt difficult in a way that felt out of the player's control. Through observations from my own play and other playtesters, as well as studying some existing rhythm games, I implemented a few new features into the design which ultimately maintained the sense of difficulty but made it feel within the player's control.


### **What I Learned**

This project came with many challenges, both technical and social. 

When I was brought on to _after us, the flood_, the previous programmer had just left the project and both of the other people on the development team were 2D artists. The team initially only needed a VFX artist, but after realising that the rhythm game needed to be re-engineered, I stepped up as a programmer to handle this task. This came with many challenges and I learned a great deal about programming, including how to use state machines and singletons in Unity, and how to read and debug other people's code.

Additionally, I learned a lot about working in team environments and with people I was not familiar with. Prior to joining the team, I had not met either of the two artists or the previous programmer. Although daunting, it was also highly beneficial in developing communication skills. 

This project was put under extra pressure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and being compassionate towards both myself and my teammates became ever more important (not to say that it isn't already!). The team, knowing that the virus threw a wrench into our plans and would cause issues in production, made extreme efforts to continue meeting at the normal work times, getting on calls (even if they were completely silent as we all clattered away at our keyboards) and making sure to communicate the schedules and production goals extra clearly.
