### **About _after us, the flood_**

_after us, the flood_ is a narrative game with rhythm mechanics that explores themes of stagnation. 

You wake up as Piper, an amnesiac with a knack for music. Together with the overly friendly Fidel, a resident of the strange yet nostalgic town you've found yourself in, romp around in a dilapidated mall and learn more about a place, and people, who've chosen to be frozen in time.

### **My Role on the Project**

As part of the Game Design BFA, all graduating seniors are required to complete a capstone project. I joined the team halfway through the project as a VFX artist but also ended up working heavily as a programmer.

As a VFX artist, I designed various visual effects such as dissolving and ripple effects seen in the rhythm game. 

When I joined the team, the rhythm game had already been implemented using physics, but after some consultation with programming professors, I was advised to redevelop the system and make it time based. 


### **What I Learned**

This project came with many challenges, both technical and social. 

When I was brought on to _after us, the flood_, the previous programmer had just left the project and both of the other people on the development team were 2D artists. The team initially only needed a VFX artist, but after realising that the rhythm game needed to be re-engineered, I stepped up as a programmer to handle this task. This came with many challenges and I learned a great deal about programming, including how to use state machines and singletons in Unity, and how to read and debug other people's code.

Additionally, I learned a lot about working in team environments and with people I was not familiar with. Before I joined the project, I was not familiar with either of the two artists or the previous programmer. Although daunting, it was also highly beneficial in developing communication skills.

## My role on the project
Although I was originally onboarded as a VFX artist, I ended up working heavily as a programmer as well. 

My main contributions to the project were implementing non-animated visual feedback, basic audio passing (excluding the music) and the current implementation of the rhythm game.
