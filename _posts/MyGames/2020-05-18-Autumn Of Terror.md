### **About The Autumn of Terror**
Set in Whitechapel, whispers of a murderer are afoot in this dense, poverty-ridden Victorian London Borough. Local police are clueless, and the people are getting restless. Rumors are spreading of a man who calls himself by the name "Jack the Ripper" and stalks the streets, using the cover of darkness to murder the innocent civilians of Whitechapel.  

In this first-person open-world styled adventure game, you, Frederick George Abberline, are tasked with finding and putting an end to this man's crimes. Through traversing 5 explorable locations--a police station, a pub, a local neighbourhood, the main street and the docks--speak to civilians and find clues to change the course of history and uncover the identity of one of the most infamous serial killers in history, Jack the Ripper. 


### **Why?**
As part of a final project for intermediate game design, the class was tasked with coming up with a detailed pitch for a game. I, along with two classmates, pitched The Autumn of Terror. The pitch detailed it as a Triple-A, Heavy Rain-styled third-person, action-adventure game with multiple playable characters and multiple endings. 
The project was only intended to be a pitch, my classmate Ron (check out their work [here](https://ronojoymitra.itch.io/)!) and I liked the idea so much that we've decided to start building it out in Unity. Although it certainly will not be a AAA production, we do still believe we can produce something that is of high quality and enjoyable to play. 

My role on this project includes lead 3D artist and modeller, level designer, player functionality programmer, UI designer. This project is made in Unity, using Maya, Photoshop and Substance Painter. 


**Project Start Date: 5 June, 2020**

**Intended Finish Date: End of August, 2020**

_The pub interior and exterior are fully completed!_

![Autumn of Terror 20 July WIP 1](/assets/artwork/MyGames/AutumnOfTerror/PoliceStationLayout.jpg)

_Unfortunately, Ron and I were unable to find a lot of documentation for the layouts of Victorian police stations... So this layout is a mix of modern-day police station layouts and those from the early 1900s! There are a few areas that have been removed, of course, since they have no reason to exist in the game (But maybe we can add in closed doors implying them!) such as restrooms, storage closets, private detective rooms, break rooms, etc... I particularly paid close attention to which rooms connected to each other when designing the layout. For example, in many police stations, the first room (after the front desk area) was the bullpen. Next after these would often be a stretch of small offices, break rooms, rest rooms, etc... (which have been removed for the sake of this project). Then there would come holding cells/the detention area and the interrogation room. Another important thing I noticed is that many police stations have multiple places to enter the interrogation room: one near the detention area (to move suspects easily) and at least one more that leads to the main office area._

_With all of these observations in mind, low and behold, we've got a simplified police station!_

_Welcome to the Black Boot! The explorable pub which will be populated with shady NPCs to interact with!_

_The following two pictures are the scene built in Maya and then brought into Unity, with a few changes and re-arrangements._

_Travelling to the pub will start the player outside of the Black Boot, a pub located in a shady back alley off the main street of Whitechapel. I did lots of research into Victorian pubs in Whitechapel, and am most prominently trying to capture the claustrophobic feeling and narrowness of the interior. Ron will be responsible for lighting the area and I can already say: I'm really looking forward to texturing everything!_


#### Work in Progress Update from 10 July, 2020

_Not so much to show this time around, unfortunately, but we have gotten a move on writing character dialogue and the inventory system! Each location will feature a handful of interactable NPCs that you can show evidence to and they will react with information._

_Game writing will be divided up between me and Ron, but I will solely be responsible for the inventory and item system. I originally thought I had a clear idea of how to implement the inventory system. Technically speaking, it should just be a list and then some UI to display. After a bit of research and the Internet yelling "Oh, god, do not use an array or list", I decided to take the opportunity to learn and implement the inventory using Scriptable Objects! I'd learned about them before, but didn't understand them well the first time around. I followed a mix of tutorials and advice from Unity forums and we now have a functioning inventory system in which the player can pick up items and equip them! Future features will also include being able to open inventory, click and object and reveal some information about it._

_Blockout with first few models added to the main scene. This area is the main plaza. The game will feature five different locations total: the main plaza, the police station, a pub, the docks and a Whitechapel neighbourhood._

_Although the game will be first-person, the player still has a character model. This was just an early test scene deciding scale, but I'd already made a few models that are the final FBX assets, so here's a little peak of the art direction! We decided that, since neither of us (the two developers) are specialists in animation, the character models will be more human-shaped rather than semi-realistic human figures. Most notably, the models don't have distinct legs. They'll just have to slide along the floor conveyer belt style! It would be ideal for each character to have proper walking animations, but for now, it's unfortunately not a consideration._
