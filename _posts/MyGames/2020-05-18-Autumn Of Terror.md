### **About The Autumn of Terror**
Set in Whitechapel, whispers of a murderer are afoot in this dense, poverty-ridden Victorian London Borough. Local police are clueless, and the people are getting restless. Rumors are spreading of a man who calls himself by the name "Jack the Ripper" and stalks the streets, using the cover of darkness to murder the innocent civilians of Whitechapel.  

In this first-person adventure game, you, Frederick George Abberline, are tasked with finding and putting an end to this man's crimes. Walk around Victorian Whitechapel and, with the help of your monocle, speak to civilians and find clues to change the course of history and uncover the identity of one of the most infamous serial killers in history, Jack the Ripper.


### **Why?**
As part of a final project for intermediate game design, the class was tasked with coming up with a detailed pitch for a game. I, along with two classmates, pitched The Autumn of Terror. The pitch detailed it as a Triple-A, Heavy Rain-styled third-person, action-adventure game with multiple playable characters and multiple endings. 
The project was only intended to be a pitch, my classmate Ron (check out their work [here](https://ronojoymitra.itch.io/)!) and I liked the idea so much that we've decided to start building it out in Unity. Although it certainly will not be a AAA production, we do still believe we can produce something that is of high quality and enjoyable to play. 

My role on this project includes art direction, 3D modeller and player programmer.


**Project Start Date: 5 June, 2020**

**Intended Finish Date: End of August, 2020**

_Not so much to show this time around, unfortunately, but we have gotten a move on writing character dialogue and the inventory system! Each location will feature a handful of interactable NPCs that you can show evidence to and they will react with information.

Game writing will be divided up between me and Ron, but I will solely be responsible for the inventory and item system. I originally thougth I had a clear idea of how to implement the inventory system. Technically speaking, it should just be a list and then some UI to display. After a bit of research and the Internet yelling "Oh, god, do not use an array or list", I decided to take the opportunity to learn and implement the inventory using Scriptable Objects! I'd learned about them before, but didn't understand them well the first time around. I followed a mix of tutorials and advice from Unity forums and we now have a functioning inventory system in which the player can pick up items and equip them! Future features will also include being able to open inventory, click and object and reveal some information about it._

_Blockout with first few models added to the main scene. This area is the main plaza. The game will feature five different locations total: the main plaza, the police station, a pub, the docks and a Whitechapel neighbourhood._
