### **About The Autumn of Terror**
Set in Whitechapel, whispers of a murderer are afoot in this dense, poverty-ridden Victorian London Borough. Local police are clueless, and the people are getting restless. Rumors are spreading of a man who calls himself by the name "Jack the Ripper" and stalks the streets, using the cover of darkness to murder the innocent civilians of Whitechapel.  

In this first-person adventure game, you, Frederick George Abberline, are tasked with finding and putting an end to this man's crimes. Walk around Victorian Whitechapel and, with the help of your monocle, speak to civilians and find clues to change the course of history and uncover the identity of one of the most infamous serial killers in history, Jack the Ripper.


### **Why?**
As part of a final project for intermediate game design, the class was tasked with coming up with a detailed pitch for a game. I, along with two classmates, pitched The Autumn of Terror. The pitch detailed it as a Triple-A, Heavy Rain-styled third-person, action-adventure game with multiple playable characters and multiple endings. 
The project was only intended to be a pitch, my classmate Ron and I liked the idea so much that we've decided to start building it out in Unity. Although it certainly will not be a AAA production, we do still believe we can produce something that is of high quality and enjoyable to play.

**Project Start Date: 5 June, 2020**

**Intended Finish Date: End of August, 2020**
