### **About The Autumn of Terror**
Set in Whitechapel, whispers of a murderer are afoot in this dense, poverty-ridden Victorian London Borough. Local police are clueless, and the people are getting restless. Rumors are spreading of a man who calls himself by the name "Jack the Ripper" and stalks the streets, using the cover of darkness to murder the innocent civilians of Whitechapel.  

In this first-person open-world styled adventure game, you, Frederick George Abberline, are tasked with finding and putting an end to this man's crimes. Through traversing 5 explorable locations--a police station, a pub, a local neighbourhood, the main street and the docks--speak to civilians and find clues to change the course of history and uncover the identity of one of the most infamous serial killers in history, Jack the Ripper. 


### **Gamplay Summary**
The player will walk around, explore, find clues and speak to NPCs to get information on the clues. The player will be able to take items from the inventory, show them to NPCs and the NPCs will react with potentially useful information! The player will also have a notebook, which can be opened and each encountered NPC will have an entry in the notebook and a space for the player to take notes on them! With the information gained from NPCs, take notes and try to deduce the identity of Jack the Ripper! 


### **Why?**
As part of a final project for intermediate game design, the class was tasked with coming up with a detailed pitch for a game. I, along with two classmates, pitched The Autumn of Terror. The pitch detailed it as a Triple-A, Heavy Rain-styled third-person, action-adventure game with multiple playable characters and multiple endings. 
The project was only intended to be a pitch, my classmate Ron (check out their work [here](https://ronojoymitra.itch.io/)!) and I liked the idea so much that we've decided to start building it out in Unity. Although it certainly will not be a AAA production, we do still believe we can produce something that is of high quality and enjoyable to play. 

My technical roles on this project include lead 3D artist and modeller, level designer, player functionality programmer, UI designer and narrative designer/writer. I am also solely responsible for maintaining the design document and ongoing documentation. This project is made in Unity, using Maya, Photoshop and Substance Painter. 


**Project Start Date: 5 June, 2020**

**Intended Finish Date: End of August, 2020**

_Holy updates, Batman! I've actually been trying to write an update for the last 3 days, but I've been so busy clacking away at the project and making progress! Ron has been away on vacation for the last week, so I took this opportunity to sprint without having to worry about making changes to the same thing!_

_Most significantly, the Inventory and Notebook system have been completed. The player can pick up objects of interest, they will be added to the inventory (displayed on the left-hand panel in the first image) and clicking on them will make them appear enlarged on the right-hand panel, along with a short, generic description about the object. The second image shows the Notebook. After encountering certain notable NPCs, they will appear in the Notebook. Clicking on their name will display some small information about them and a place for the player to take notes on them!_ 

_On top of polishing up the UI systems, I tackled many tasks (like the day-evening cycle and progression of time, moving between the different areas). I continued adding models to scenes and as of now, the Main Street (third and fourth images), Police Station are also practically completely done. The neighbourhood and docks are nearing completion._
_I also started lighting the scenes! The pub is mostly lit, the intensities need to be adjusted based on NPC placement, and maybe a little once textures as added as well, but all the light sources have been placed. Adding lights really added a lot of character to the scene!_

_Up until now, we've only been able to test individual systems, but the game should be playtestable (on the narrative) front by the end of the week!_

_Something that Ron and I discussed a lot was travelling between locations in this game and ultimately decided there will be two modes of travelling between locations: opening a UI map and teleporting, or walking between locations. The former will work very similarly to how warping works in Breath of the Wild--the player will open a map of Whitechapel, choose the location and be sent there. The latter will be the same as literally walking from one location to another. In the first image, there is a layout of Main Street, which will have access to all four other locations (the pub, the docks, the neighbourhood and the police station). Some other locations will connect to others, but some will not. For example, it will be possible to go straight from the pub to the neighbourhood (since they are adjacent) but impossible to go straight from the police station to the docks. In order to go from the police station to the docks, the player will have to warp or travel back to the Main Street and head south towards the docks._

_So far, I've mainly been blocking out and art passing the police station (since it is where the game begins) and the pub. I knew from early on that the Main Street would be one of the more challenging locations to populate with assets because it is an open space. Art passing this area doesn't just end with the areas that the player can move around in, it goes beyond. Into the seeable distance, there has to be models simulating buildings and making it feel like a city. On the first layout image, they lightly whited-out area in the center of the image is the tiny area in which the player can actually move around and interact in. Head too far in one direction and the player will hit a collider that will act as the warp zone to another location. In order to simulate the feeling of a bigger city, I have added a few building models just in the immediate area outside of the interactable zone and plan on making a skybox to further simulate urban life. As a metropolitan hub, the Main Street location will have more models than any other location to simulate business. More NPCs will be placed eventually, and some with navmeshes. I will likely be removing a few wagons on the road, as they will eventually be moving on the street rather than be placed idly like they are right now!_

![Autumn of Terror 20 July WIP 1](/assets/artwork/MyGames/AutumnOfTerror/PoliceStationLayout.jpg)

_Unfortunately, Ron and I were unable to find a lot of documentation for the layouts of Victorian police stations... So this layout is a mix of modern-day police station layouts and those from the early 1900s! There are a few areas that have been removed, of course, since they have no reason to exist in the game (But maybe we can add in closed doors implying them!) such as restrooms, storage closets, private detective rooms, break rooms, etc... I particularly paid close attention to which rooms connected to each other when designing the layout. For example, in many police stations, the first room (after the front desk area) was the bullpen. Next after these would often be a stretch of small offices, break rooms, rest rooms, etc... (which have been removed for the sake of this project). Then there would come holding cells/the detention area and the interrogation room. Another important thing I noticed is that many police stations have multiple places to enter the interrogation room: one near the detention area (to move suspects easily) and at least one more that leads to the main office area._

_With all of these observations in mind, low and behold, we've got a simplified police station!_

_Welcome to the Black Boot! The explorable pub which will be populated with shady NPCs to interact with!_

_The following two pictures are the scene built in Maya and then brought into Unity, with a few changes and re-arrangements._

_Travelling to the pub will start the player outside of the Black Boot, a pub located in a shady back alley off the main street of Whitechapel. I did lots of research into Victorian pubs in Whitechapel, and am most prominently trying to capture the claustrophobic feeling and narrowness of the interior. Ron will be responsible for lighting the area and I can already say: I'm really looking forward to texturing everything!_


#### Work in Progress Update from 10 July, 2020 

![Autumn of Terror 10 July WIP](/assets/artwork/MyGames/AutumnOfTerror/AutumnOfTerror_WIP_2020_Jul10.jpg)

_Not so much to show this time around, unfortunately, but we have gotten a move on writing character dialogue and the inventory system! Each location will feature a handful of interactable NPCs that you can show evidence to and they will react with information._

_Game writing will be divided up between me and Ron, but I will solely be responsible for the inventory and item system. I originally thought I had a clear idea of how to implement the inventory system. Technically speaking, it should just be a list and then some UI to display. After a bit of research and the Internet yelling "Oh, god, do not use an array or list", I decided to take the opportunity to learn and implement the inventory using Scriptable Objects! I'd learned about them before, but didn't understand them well the first time around. I followed a mix of tutorials and advice from Unity forums and we now have a functioning inventory system in which the player can pick up items and equip them! Future features will also include being able to open inventory, click and object and reveal some information about it._


#### Work in Progress Update from 29 June, 2020

![Autumn of Terror WIP](/assets/artwork/MyGames/AutumnOfTerror/AutumnOfTerror_WIP2.jpg)

_Blockout with first few models added to the main scene. This area is the main plaza. The game will feature five different locations total: the main plaza, the police station, a pub, the docks and a Whitechapel neighbourhood._

_Although the game will be first-person, the player still has a character model. This was just an early test scene deciding scale, but I'd already made a few models that are the final FBX assets, so here's a little peak of the art direction! We decided that, since neither of us (the two developers) are specialists in animation, the character models will be more human-shaped rather than semi-realistic human figures. Most notably, the models don't have distinct legs. They'll just have to slide along the floor conveyer belt style! It would be ideal for each character to have proper walking animations, but for now, it's unfortunately not a consideration._
