About Cloud Forest
Welcome to the Cloud Forest, a calming digital greenhouse. Make your way through the virtual forest and use the powered up lotuses scattered all over the space to dynamically change the space around you. 

My Role on the Project
I was the lead 3D artist and visual director on this project. I was responsible for creating all of the models in the game (using maya) and defining the visual aesthetic. This included deciding the colour palette, what objects should go into the scene and determining the opacity, emissivity and shape of the material on the digital plants. 

What I Learned 
Cloud Forest was the largest collaborative project that I’ve done using Unreal Engine. I learned a lot about the technical aspects of the engine such as creating materials in Hypershade, blueprinting advanced gameplay mechanics and using the landscaping tool. 
Additionally, this project was my first experience acting as lead visual designer. Not only did I learn about the important decisions necessary to create a visual aesthetic, I also learned how to communicate that vision to others working on the project. 



























Welcome to the Cloud Forest, a calming digital greenhouse in which the player walks around, picks up power sources in the form of lotuses, and places them on pedestals to dynamically change the environment around them.

## My role on the project
I was the primary 3D artist and general visual director on the project. All 3D models were made by me and I made all decisions on what the environment objects should be and the colour palette.
