### **About Cloud Forest**
Welcome to the Cloud Forest, a calming digital greenhouse. Make your way through the virtual forest and use the powered up lotuses scattered all over the space to dynamically change the space around you.

### **My Role on the Project**
I was the lead 3D artist and visual director on this project. I was responsible for creating all of the models in the game (using maya) and defining the visual aesthetic. This included deciding the colour palette, what objects should go into the scene and determining the opacity, emissivity and shape of the material on the digital plants.

### **What I Learned**
Cloud Forest was the largest collaborative project that I've done using Unreal Engine. I learned a lot about the technical aspects of the engine such as creating materials in Hypershade, blueprinting advanced gameplay mechanics and using the landscaping tool. 
Additionally, this project was my first experience acting as lead visual designer. Not only did I learn about the important decisions necessary to create a visual aesthetic, I also learned how to communicate that vision to others working on the project.
