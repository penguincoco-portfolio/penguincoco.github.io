  <b> About Me </b>
  <p>
    Hi, there! My name is Sammy and I'm a recent graduate of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Game Design and minors in Japanese and Computer Science.
    </p>

   <b> How I Became a Game Developer </b>
   <p>
I'm originally from Boston, Massachusetts but have spent the last four years living in New York City. When I first matriculated at NYU in the autumn of 2016, I was part of the College of Arts and Science. Although I've always loved drawing and wanted to pursue something artistic, I felt that I had to study something more "practical" and was planning to study biology. It was a subject I was good at in high school and I did have some interest in becoming a medical researcher.
</p>

<p>
Through my first two semesters, I took a mix of courses in science and other disciplines to explore my options. In autumn of 2017, I was running out of time to declare a major but still didn't take any classes in other departments that interested me enough to pursue them. It was then that two things overlapped almost perfectly: firstly, I was taking an intro to computer programming course. Secondly, I was hating my biology course with every ounce of my existence. To my surprise, I found the computer programming course more intriguing than anything I'd taken so far at university. Not because I loved programming, but because my professor helped me to understand the visual and artistic part of computer science. I told my roommate this and she told me that I should check out the game design department in the Tisch School of the Arts. I didn't really even know what game design was, let alone that there were academic departments for it, but I decided to take a leap of faith: I dropped out of my biology class, thus effectively ending my time as a biology major, and enrolled in one of the game design department's courses that was open to students from other schools: intro to programming for games. 
</p>

<p>
That first half of the semester, I made my first ever game. It was an average paddle game in which the player moves the paddle around with a mouse to keep balls from getting past. The twist was that balls continuously spawned, and rather than bouncing just one around the screen, multiple would. In retrospect, it was a terrible game, because I still had no idea what game design was, but I also cannot forget it because it was when I had my movie-moment epiphany. I remember thinking to myself, "I don't understand this, but I want to." It felt like the perfect intersection between my long love for art and my newfound interest in technology. I spent the rest of the semester preparing my portfolio and application for the transfer to Game Design. In December 2017, I was notified that I'd gotten into the program, and though I was a little apprehensive about the decision, formally transferred into Game Design in December 2017. In January 2018, I began my life as a game designer. 
</p>

<p>
Since then, my life has changed in ways I'd never imagined. I didn't grow up with games--I wanted to play them, but never had consoles around the house and didn't have computers until I was older and much busier with school. Now my life revolves entirely around games: playing them, making them, writing about them, reading about them. 
</p>

<p>
I never used to think too much about games, but I've come to realise that they are so much more than just entertainment. I've seen games bring people together, I've seen games help people heal. This goes for more than just players too, but to all the developers behind the product. 
</p>

<p>
It was a privilege to find myself and get to do what I love throughout my time in university, and I hope I continue to do that as I start my career as a game developer.
